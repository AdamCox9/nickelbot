Use this platform with caution.
Use this platform with exchange accounts that have enough currency that you are willing to lose.
Use this platform as though it might be malicious code.
It has not had any security audit whatsoever.
Ensure that your API Keys are only accesible from your server's IP address.
Ensure that you disable withdrawels on the API key's that you use with this software.
This platform is capable of creating buy/sell market orders that can drain your exchange balances.
There could be bots that will collect the buy/sell market orders from a different account that could essentially steal your funds.
The code can create margin orders that might cause immediate liquidation of your account.
It is not safe to use this software on a system that has any unencrypted software or encrypted software with the keys.
Do not put other bots on the same operating system since they might contain your API Keys/Secrets with withdraw enabled and this software could potentially provide access to those keys.
Do not trust updates that you pull from this repository since someone could get into my server and push a bad copy to github. I do have my git software keys password protected and access github with an API Key/Secret as is available by github.

The code on this repository is running at http://www.nickelbot.com/

I hope that you use this code to build your own custom website and build your own custom bots to sell or use while also contributing the the common platform. There is opportunity for many people to build businesses around this platform and I hope you are all one of them!

Good luck!
